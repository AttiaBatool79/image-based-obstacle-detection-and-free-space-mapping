# Image-Based Obstacle Detection and Free-Space Mapping for Path Planning

##  Project Overview
This project implements an image-based obstacle detection and path planning system using classical Digital Image Processing techniques.  
The system detects obstacles from an input image, extracts free-space, and generates a collision-free path without using any dataset or machine learning model.

This project is developed as a **Complex Engineering Problem (CEP)** for the course **Digital Image Processing (CP-406)**.
